## Repository overview

In this directory you will find all data and R scripts that allows to
fully reproduce the analysis presented in the manuscript entitled “There
and Back to the Present: An Evolutionary Tale on Biological Diversity”,
in which we we introduce an individual-based simulation approach coupled
to Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) that allows to parameterize
the adaptation rate of species niche positions along the evolution of a
monophyletic lineage, and the intensity of dispersal limitation between
local assemblages potentially connected by dispersal (metacommunity).
The analytical tool was implemented in an R package called
[mcfly](https://github.com/GabrielNakamura/mcfly). A preprint version of
this work can be found [clicking

## How to use this directory

In R open the script read\_data\_libraries.R, that contain all data and
libraries required to run the analysis presented in
Test\_Sigmodontinae.R and SimulatedData\_mcfly.R
